2. Using the most up to date best practices and the latest stable version of Angular, we will build a To-Do application (frontend only). Let's start with a fresh angular project.

3. Create a new Angular component for displaying a list of tasks. Implement basic form to add new task with description field.

4. Add 'add' button functionality.

5. Add the ability to delete tasks from the list. Each task should have a delete button (with an icon).

6. Add task editing, when clicking on a icon next to a task is should be editable. After saving the changes should be visible immiediately.

7. Add the ability to mark a task as completed using a checkbox. Completed tasks should be styled differently.

8. Implement task filtering, show: 'all', 'active', 'completed' tasks based on ther completion status. Add toggle buttons for switching views.

9. Persis the To-Do list in localStorage so that the task list is restored when the page is reloaded.

10. Add a due date field to tasks, if the due date is in the past, display red warning label next to a task.
